# Companion 

## Description
Companion is a software that tracks Telegram channels, automatically translates their content (currently into Hebrew), and posts it on a dedicated channel. It features a duplicate scanner to avoid reposting messages and periodically reviews old messages to maintain content uniqueness. Future enhancements include filtering non-informative messages (like ads, propaganda, etc.), tagging messages with relevant labels for subscriber-filtered viewing, and scalability to support multiple languages and channels.

## Installation
TBD

## Usage
While Companion is currently tailored for specific use, it has potential applications for users interested in content aggregation and automated translation. For example, it could be adapted for tracking and translating news sources, educational material, or any other content distributed through Telegram channels.
